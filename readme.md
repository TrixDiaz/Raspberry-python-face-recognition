## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Raspberry-python-face-recognition
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Update system packages
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install required system packages
sudo apt install -y python3-pip python3-venv cmake

# Install OpenCV dependencies
sudo apt install -y libopencv-dev python3-opencv

# Install PiCamera2
sudo apt install -y python3-picamera2

# Create virtual environment (recommended)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install Python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Enable Camera Interface

```bash
sudo raspi-config
# Navigate to: Interface Options ‚Üí Camera ‚Üí Enable
# Reboot when prompted
```

## üìñ Usage

### 1. Training the Model

#### Capture Training Images

```bash
python image_capture.py
```

- Press **SPACE** to capture photos
- Press **Q** to quit
- Images are saved in `dataset/[person_name]/` directory

#### Train the Recognition Model

```bash
python model_training.py
```

- Processes all images in the dataset folder
- Creates `encodings.pickle` file with face encodings

### 2. Running Face Recognition

#### Basic Face Recognition (No GPIO)

```bash
python facial_recognition.py
```

#### Face Recognition with GPIO Control

```bash
python facial_recognition_hardware.py
```

### 3. Controls

- **Q**: Quit the application
- **SPACE**: Capture training images (in capture mode)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Face Recognition Settings

Edit the configuration variables in the Python files:

```python
DISTANCE_THRESHOLD = 0.4  # Recognition sensitivity (0.3-0.6 recommended)
cv_scaler = 4  # Performance scaling factor
```

### Authorization Settings

In `facial_recognition_hardware.py`, modify the authorized users:

```python
authorized_names = ["trix", "john", "jane"]  # Add authorized user names
```

### GPIO Configuration

```python
output = LED(14)  # Change pin number as needed
```

## üéØ Features Explained

### Face Recognition

- Uses HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) for face detection
- Employs deep learning models for face encoding
- Supports real-time processing with configurable performance scaling

### Motion Detection

- Background subtraction algorithm for motion detection
- Visual bell icon indicator in upper right corner
- Configurable sensitivity settings

### Authorization System

- **Green Box**: Authorized users
- **Orange Box**: Known but not authorized users
- **Red Box**: Unknown users
- GPIO control for authorized access

### Performance Optimization

- Frame scaling for improved performance
- FPS monitoring and display
- Efficient memory management

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Camera Not Detected

```bash
# Check camera connection
vcgencmd get_camera

# Expected output: supported=1 detected=1
```

#### Low FPS Performance

- Increase `cv_scaler` value (e.g., from 4 to 8)
- Reduce camera resolution in configuration
- Ensure adequate power supply (2.5A+ recommended)

#### Recognition Accuracy Issues

- Adjust `DISTANCE_THRESHOLD` (lower = more strict)
- Capture more training images (20-50 per person)
- Ensure good lighting conditions
- Use high-quality images for training

#### GPIO Issues

- Check pin connections
- Verify GPIO pin numbers
- Ensure proper power supply

### Performance Tips

- Use a fast microSD card (Class 10 or better)
- Enable GPU memory split: `sudo raspi-config` ‚Üí Advanced Options ‚Üí Memory Split ‚Üí 128
- Close unnecessary applications
- Use a powered USB hub for additional peripherals
